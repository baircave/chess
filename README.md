## Summary/Instructions
This implementation of chess was made in Ruby and was designed to be played by two human players in the terminal. In order to play, simply download the files in this repository, navigate to that directory in your terminal, and run `ruby game.rb`. To exit the program, use 'ctrl+c'. To select pieces to move, navigate using the arrow keys, use either enter or space to select, and confirm a new space by pressing enter/space again.
