## Summary/Instructions
This implementation of chess was made in Ruby and was designed to be played by two human players in the terminal. Assuming you have Ruby and Homebrew installed on your computer, then simply download the files in this repository, navigate to that directory in your terminal, run `bundle install`, and then run `ruby game.rb` to play. To exit the program, use 'ctrl+c'. To select pieces to move, navigate using the arrow keys, use either enter or space to select, and confirm a new space by pressing enter/space again.
